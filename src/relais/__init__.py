Relais: High-Performance Async Streaming Pipelines

A modern Python library for building concurrent, streaming data processing pipelines.
Optimized for I/O-bound operations with true streaming architecture and directional
cancellation for maximum performance.

Key Features:
- üöÄ True streaming with bounded memory usage
- ‚ö° Directional cancellation (take() stops upstream processing)
- üîÑ Concurrent processing with proper backpressure
- üõ°Ô∏è Flexible error handling (FAIL_FAST, IGNORE, COLLECT)
- üìä Perfect for LLM evaluation, API processing, data enrichment

Quick Start:
    import relais as r

    # Basic pipeline
    result = await (range(10) | r.Map(lambda x: x * 2) | r.Take(5)).collect()

    # Streaming processing
    async for item in (data | r.Map(async_transform) | r.Filter(validate)).stream():
        process(item)

    # Error handling
    pipeline = r.Pipeline([r.Map(might_fail)], error_policy=r.ErrorPolicy.IGNORE)
    results = await pipeline.collect(data)
